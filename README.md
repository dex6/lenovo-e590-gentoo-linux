This repo contains my notes, scripts, configs, and some know-how about installing and using Gentoo Linux on a Lenovo Thinkpad E590 machine.

Notes are quite rough, chaotic and sometimes hard to follow, cause I don't have any intention (nor enough time...) to create "definitive guide". I just wish to have some space where I can store this knowledge and share some of my settings and stuff. If you can use it, have fun and good luck :)

Unless stated otherwise, all code/scripts are released under BSD-3-Clause and all the rest (text/images/configs/etc) under CC-BY-4.0.
