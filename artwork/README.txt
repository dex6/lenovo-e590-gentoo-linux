Notes:

All this stuff is for Full HD resolution (1920x1080). These themes may look
bad on 4K or HD-ready, etc. Also I'm not an artist, so simplicity is not only
an art, but rather the only option for me ;)

The goal is flicker-free boot through all startup stages, including BIOS, disk
unlocker, kexec to OS kernel and launching X. I'm using SDDM + KDE Plasma with
autologin enabled, thus there's no theme for SDDM cause I'm not looking at it
anyway. The transition from Plymouth to Plasma splash sometimes goes through a
black screen, sometimes it goes right from one to the other. This is the
weakest part of the chain, probably, but it's enough for now.
